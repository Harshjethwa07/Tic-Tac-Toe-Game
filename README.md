Here’s a list of **HTML semantic elements**, which are elements that clearly describe their meaning both to the browser and the developer:

---

### 🔹 **Structural / Layout Semantic Elements**
These elements define the structure of a web page:

- `<header>` – Defines a header for a document or a section
- `<nav>` – Defines navigation links
- `<main>` – Specifies the main content of a document
- `<section>` – Defines a section in a document
- `<article>` – Defines an independent, self-contained content
- `<aside>` – Defines content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar)
- `<footer>` – Defines a footer for a document or section

---

### 🔹 **Text-level Semantic Elements**

These describe the meaning of text:

- `<h1>` to `<h6>` – Headings, from most important (`<h1>`) to least (`<h6>`)
- `<p>` – Paragraph
- `<blockquote>` – A section that is quoted from another source
- `<q>` – Short inline quote
- `<abbr>` – Abbreviation or acronym
- `<cite>` – Title of a creative work (e.g., book name)
- `<dfn>` – Definition of a term
- `<address>` – Contact information
- `<time>` – Defines date and/or time
- `<code>` – Fragment of computer code
- `<kbd>` – Keyboard input
- `<samp>` – Sample output from computer code
- `<var>` – Variable in a mathematical expression or programming context
- `<mark>` – Marked or highlighted text
- `<strong>` – Important text (typically bold)
- `<em>` – Emphasized text (typically italic)
- `<small>` – Side comments or small text
- `<del>` – Deleted (removed) text
- `<ins>` – Inserted (added) text

---

### 🔹 **Grouping Content Semantic Elements**

- `<figure>` – Self-contained content, often with a caption
- `<figcaption>` – Caption for `<figure>`
- `<details>` – Disclosure widget (collapsible content)
- `<summary>` – Summary for the `<details>` element
- `<fieldset>` – Groups related elements within a form
- `<legend>` – Caption for `<fieldset>`
- `<label>` – Label for a form input

---

### 🔹 **Table-related Semantic Elements**

- `<table>` – Defines a table
- `<caption>` – Caption or title of a table
- `<thead>` – Groups the header content in a table
- `<tbody>` – Groups the body content in a table
- `<tfoot>` – Groups the footer content in a table
- `<tr>` – Table row
- `<th>` – Table header cell
- `<td>` – Table data cell

---

### ✅ Notes:
- **Semantic HTML** improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability.
- Non-semantic elements like `<div>` and `<span>` don't convey any meaning on their own.

Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game 🎮
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe (X and O) game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns clicking
 on squares to place their symbols, and the game automatically checks for a winner after each move.
Features ✨
Interactive 3×3 game board
Turn-based gameplay (O starts first, alternates with X)
Automatic winner detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
Win announcement with a message display
Reset/New Game buttons to restart the game
Disabled board after a win to prevent further moves
How It Works 🧠
Key Variables
boxes: Stores all 9 grid squares (elements with class .box).
turnO: Boolean to track turns (true = O's turn, false = X's turn).
winpattern: Array of winning combinations (e.g., [0, 1, 2] for top row).
msgContainer/msg: Elements to display the winner message.
Core Functions
resetGame():
Resets turnO to true (O's turn).
Enables all boxes and hides the winner message.
disableBoxes(): Disables all squares after a win.
enableBoxes(): Clears and re-enables squares for a new game.
showWinner(winner): Displays "Winner is [X/O]" and disables the board.
checkWinner(): Compares box values against winpattern to detect wins.
Game Logic
Players click squares to place their symbol (O or X).
Each click:
Updates the square’s text and disables it.
Toggles turnO to switch turns.
Calls checkWinner().
On win:
showWinner() displays the result and disables the board.
Setup Instructions ⚙️
HTML Structure:
   <div class="game-container">
     <!-- 9 squares with class "box" -->
     <button class="box"></button>
     <!-- ... -->
   </div>
   <div class="msg-container hide">
     <p id="msg"></p>
   </div>
   <button id="reset-btn">Reset</button>
   <button id="newgame-btn">New Game</button>
   <script src="script.js"></script>
html
Copy
Link JavaScript: Save the game logic in script.js and link it in HTML.
Open in Browser: Launch index.html to play.
How to Play 🕹️
Click any empty square to place your symbol.
First to 3 in a row wins!
Use Reset to clear the current game or New Game for a fresh start.
Future Enhancements 🔮
Draw detection: Announce ties when all squares are filled.
Score tracking: Record wins across multiple games.
AI opponent: Add single-player mode.
Styling: Improve UI with CSS animations.
Why This README Works:
Concise & Structured: Clear sections for features, setup, and logic.
Accurate Code References: Fixed typos (e.g., disableBoxes instead of disableseBoxes).
Actionable Instructions: Steps to set up and play the game.
Future Ideas: Encourages further development.
Simply copy this into a README.md file in your project directory! For a full implementation, ensure
 your HTML/CSS matches the class/ID names referenced in the JavaScript.
